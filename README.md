Styling Highlights
Main Page:
Tasks are arranged in a grid layout with flex-wrap, ensuring responsiveness.
Task Cards:
Cards include a shadow and hover effect for an intuitive user experience.
Buttons for edit/delete are positioned at the bottom, styled with gradients and hover effects.
Form Inputs:
Arranged vertically with proper spacing.
Submit button styled with a gradient background and smooth transitions.
Responsive Design:
Adjusts layout for small and large devices using media queries.
Tasks are displayed in rows on small screens and in a grid on larger screens.
Responsive Design
The application is optimized for devices of all sizes:

Desktop: Task cards are displayed side-by-side in a grid layout.
Mobile/Tablet: Tasks are stacked vertically for easier navigation.
How to Use
Add Tasks:
Fill out the form with task details and click "Submit."
Edit Tasks:
Click the "Edit" button on a task card to populate the form with existing task details, update the fields, and submit again.
Delete Tasks:
Click the "Delete" button to remove a task permanently.
Known Issues
Data Persistence: Tasks are stored in local storage, meaning data will not persist across different browsers or devices.
Validation: Minimal validation is implemented. Adding more validation rules can improve the application.
Future Improvements
Backend Integration: Use a database like MongoDB or Firebase for data persistence.
User Authentication: Allow multiple users to manage their own tasks.
Priority Levels: Add a feature to set task priority.
Search and Filters: Implement search functionality and filter tasks by category or status.
